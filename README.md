## üìù Description
HumanForYou, a pharmaceutical company based in India with a workforce of approximately 4000 employees, has an issue where its annual empolyees turnover rate is about 15%, causing delays in projects, HR resource strain and inefficiencies in onboarding.

Project goal:
- Objective: Analyze data to identify influencing employee turnover.
- Task: Propose machine learning models to uncover insights and suggest improvements to motivate employees to stay.

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- Download the dataset files from this link: https://github.com/FlammeTik/AI_HR_Attrition/tree/d1f1f5312798d7126a1066c1f0494d3ed5b44d7d/Dataset

## :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* Jupyter Notebook

## :mag: Data Pre-processing
* Created a feature called AVG_Work_Time.
* Removed non-related columns for my study like: EmployeeCount, EmployeeID, Gender, MaritalStatus, Over18 (all had the same value "Yes") & StandardHours (all had the same value "8").
* Applied custom mapping on these 2 categorical columns: Attrition & BusinessTravel. Here is the Attrition Destribution:

* Used OneHotEncoder on these 3 categorical columns: Department, EducationField & JobRole.
* Filled missing values using mean strategy.
* Created boxplots for each column to check for outliers. Here is a box plot for Monthly Income column:

* Ploted histograms for each column to see if the data is balanced or not:

* Ploted heat map for correlation matrix:

* Applied the standard scaler since there were outliers within the data.
* Created the data pipeline encompassing all transformation steps for later use in machine learning.

## :desktop_computer:	Machine Learning
* I applied the previous data pipeline.
* Utilizing StratifiedShuffleSplit, I partitioned the data into two sets: 80% designated for training and 20% allocated for testing, ensuring representative stratification across the dataset.
* Employed five distinct classification models, systematically assessing for overfitting through cross-validation techniques. Subsequently, I computed various evaluation metrics for each model and discerned the optimal choice based on the precision score.

* Conducted hyper-parameter tuning for Random Forest Classifier, meticulously exploring various settings to ascertain the most effective combination for optimal performance.

* Tested the final model on the test set and got excellent results:
